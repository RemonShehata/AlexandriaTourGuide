    <string name="about_city">
        Alexandria is a Mediterranean port city in Egypt.
        During the Hellenistic period,
        it was home to a lighthouse ranking among the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World
        as well as a storied library. Today the library is reincarnated in the disc-shaped,
        ultramodern Bibliotheca Alexandrina. The city also has Greco-Roman landmarks,
        old-world cafes and sandy beaches. Its 15th-century seafront Qaitbay Citadel is now a museum.
